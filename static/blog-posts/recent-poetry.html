  I've been getting into writing poetry recently so here are a few poems that
  I've written.
</p>
<br />
<h3>The End</h3>
<br />
<p>A sense of death hung in the room like a thick, sickly smog.</p>
<br />
<p>
  It poured from the two-dollar-shop transistor radio in forgotten late-night
  symphonies. The crackling, deteriorated sound of better times.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  It gathered on the off-white paint that half-heartedly clung to the drywall;
  sticky with remains of the past, present, and future.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The room stood steady, unsympathetic, but still bearing the marks of
  unrelenting years of decay and bereavement carried by each and every poor soul
  dragged into its belly.
</p>
<br />
<p>I wonder how many have left that room in a bag.</p>
<br />
<p>
  The ghastly presence of countless lost souls cemented themselves in the air.
  Cemented themselves in the crevices, nooks and crannies of your mind. Begging
  and pleading to be remembered.
</p>
<br />
<p>Reduced to nothing but a lingering sense of The End.</p>

<h3>The City</h3>
<br />
<p>I want to walk you through the hazy outskirts of the suburbs of my mind.</p>
<br />
<p>
  Through transient scenes and vague characters, through effluvia of nostalgia
  and the anonymous lives of familiar strangers, then out to the country.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Down endless battered roads that lead to obscure viable future circumstances
  and prophecies built from eroded and shattered memories. To the
  all-encompassing small towns where only the crazies and the truly free can
  bear to linger for more than a few hours.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  I want to share my every living thought, assimilate my being in full. To have
  another look at me through knowing, sympathetic eyes that can effortlessly
  penetrate the exoskeleton of fear and confusion.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  But here we are, stuck in the city. An air of caution and dread hangs through
  every crevice of every street corner and every house and every cafe, like a
  god.
</p>
<br />
<p>Here I am in my vow of silent affability.</p>

<h3>The Threshold</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Ever feel like you're on the threshold of something? Like the space-time
  fabric has frayed a little bit and your peripheral vision starts to blur and
  distort...
</p>
<br />
<p>
  You walk down the street and everything looks transitory and a little too
  bright. I can remember going down old High Street and the sun beating down on
  me... closing in...
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The sun closing in on me... thoughts closing in on themselves... burgeoning
  tension in the temples and back of the neck... everything feels like a replica
  of itself in some inexplicable way...
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Think about every cell in your body and the blood pumping through your veins
  and it's really all just too much...
</p>
<br />
<p>
  All that you can do is take some god forsaken bus to nowhere; do some
  loitering and window-shopping, stare at your stale, decaying fingertips.
</p>
<br />
<p>Knock on faux wood that you're just fooling yourself.</p>
<br />
