<p>Happy (late) new year!</p>
<br />
<p>
  About a month ago I decided to refurbish an old netbook to use as a portable
  laptop, since my ThinkPad T430 is very bulky and annoying to carry around.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  A while ago, I was given a couple of broken old Acer Travelmate B110-E
  netbooks by a family member. They were originally used by a primary school, so
  you know they&#39;re only the finest quality.
</p>
<br />
<p>They were both broken in different ways:</p>
<br />
<h4 id="laptop-1">Laptop 1</h4>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Broken screen (lines all over)</li>
  <li>Would not boot past BIOS splash screen or enter setup utility</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h4 id="laptop-2">Laptop 2</h4>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Screen/bezel hinge completely snapped and detached</li>
  <li>Fan so rattly you can hear it from two rooms away</li>
  <li>Sunken in trackpad that would not come back out</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
  I was able to salvage a working laptop from the working parts (with a couple
  of upgrades and a thermal paste change) fairly easily.
</p>
<br />
<h3 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h3>
<br />
<p>The specs are really nothing special...</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Intel Celeron 1007U processor (Ivybridge, 1.50 GHz, 2 cores/threads, 17W
    TDP)
  </li>
  <li>
    8 GB 1600 MT/s memory (upgraded from 3 GB of slower, mismatched memory)
  </li>
  <li>240 GB WD Green SATA SSD (upgraded from a 120 GB Crucial M500)</li>
  <li>1366x768 @ 60Hz LCD display</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
  The only component I needed to purchase for this was a new battery which cost
  a total of $38.46 AUD from Aliexpress (with shipping). It&#39;s a pretty
  terrible battery (who would&#39;ve guessed) but it works well enough that
  I&#39;m satisfied.
</p>
<br />
<p>It also has respectable IO:</p>
<ul>
  <li>x1 Ethernet</li>
  <li>x1 VGA</li>
  <li>x1 HDMI</li>
  <li>x1 headphone/microphone jack</li>
  <li>x3 USB 2.0</li>
  <li>DC charging port (big fan of this)</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
  As much as I wish it had USB 3.0 I would not expect a low-end machine from
  2013 to have it, and it&#39;s not really a big deal. An SD card reader would
  be good as well, but also not a dealbreaker.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The form factor is very convenient, at 29.46 cm / 11.6&quot; and weighing in
  at 1.276 kg / 2.8 lbs.

<h3 id="the-software">The Software</h3>
<br />
<p>
  My OS of choice is NixOS, so that&#39;s what I installed on this thing. NixOS
  certainly isn&#39;t the most optimized Linux distribution I&#39;ve tried (that
  award would easily go to Void) but the convenience of having all of my shared
  configurations in one nix flake is my primary reason for using it.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The window manager I ended up going with is SwayFX. I would usually use
  Hyprland but SwayFX uses marginally less resources (roughly 100 MB less RAM)
  so I went with it in order to get as light of a desktop as I can (with it
  still being adequately riceable and compatible with my workflow).
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The other software I&#39;m using is:<br /><br />
  <b>Kernel:</b> Linux-zen <br />
  <b>Web Browser:</b> Firefox with Betterfox user.js and a mininal
  userChrome.css <br />
  <b>Terminal:</b> Foot <br />
  <b>Shell:</b> ZSH with Starship prompt <br />
  <b>Status Bar:</b> Waybar <br />
  <b>App Launcher:</b> Anyrun (considering switching if I can find another
  launcher that supports shadows)<br />
  <b>Notification Daemon:</b> SwayNC <br />
  <b>Editor:</b> Neovim<br />
  <b>File Manager (GUI):</b> Thunar <br />
  <b>File Manager (TUI):</b> Yazi<br />
  <b>Display Manager:</b> SDDM <br />
  <b>Music Player:</b> MPD/ncmpcpp<br />
</p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<br />
<h4 id="web-browsing">Web Browsing</h4>
<br />
<p>
  I was honestly very surprised by how usable this machine is. Web browsing is
  generally very smooth, and it can comfortably play Youtube videos at up to
  1080p with the help of enhanced-h264ify/Invidious.
</p>
<br />
<p>The extensions I have installed are:</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Ublock Origin</li>
  <li>SponsorBlock</li>
  <li>Stylus (rarely used on this machine)</li>
  <li>ViolentMonkey (Also rarely used on this machine)</li>
  <li>LocalCDN</li>
  <li>LibRedirect</li>
  <li>floccus bookmark sync</li>
  <li>ClearURLs</li>
  <li>Control Panel for Twitter</li>
  <li>enhanced-h264ify</li>
  <li>Pywalfox</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
  Websites are slightly slower than they are on my laptop or PC (as expected)
  but it&#39;s not noticeable after a short adjustment period. I wouldn&#39;t
  describe it as &quot;laggy&quot;, rather just &quot;less smooth&quot;.
</p>
<br />
<h4 id="discord">Discord</h4>
<br />
<p>
  Vesktop with custom CSS and numerous plugins can get noticeably laggy but not
  to the point where it&#39;s unusable. The vanilla discord webapp runs fairly
  effortlessly in Firefox. I usually close Vesktop if I&#39;m planning to do
  something resource intensive as it does tend to eat the CPU.
</p>
<br />
<h4 id="gaming">Gaming</h4>
<br />
<p>
  I was not expecting much at all from this, but it definitely exceeded my
  expectations!
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The first game I tried was Luanti/Minetest. It ranges from 20-60 FPS with the
  VoxeLibre mod, making it playable (but only just).
</p>
<br />
<p>
  After that I installed Duke Nukem 3D with eDuke32 and it runs flawlessly. Same
  goes for Doom with GZDoom.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The next game I tried was Minecraft which definitely surprised me the most out
  of everything I tried...
</p>
<br />
<p>
  On the latest version of Minecraft (1.21.4 currently) I was able to get it to
  run at an average of up to 78 FPS at an 80 FPS cap in a singleplayer world
  (with a few dips but still)!
</p>
<br />
<p>I use Prismlauncher with the Fabric modloader with the following mods:</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Almanac</li>
  <li>AppleSkin</li>
  <li>BadOptimizations</li>
  <li>Chunky</li>
  <li>Clumps</li>
  <li>Concurrent Chunk Management Engine</li>
  <li>Debugify</li>
  <li>Dynamic FPS</li>
  <li>EntityCulling</li>
  <li>FallingTree</li>
  <li>FerriteCore</li>
  <li>ImmediatelyFast</li>
  <li>Jade</li>
  <li>Krypton</li>
  <li>Ksyxis</li>
  <li>Let Me Despawn</li>
  <li>Lithium</li>
  <li>Mod Menu</li>
  <li>ModernFix</li>
  <li>More Culling</li>
  <li>No Telemetry</li>
  <li>Noisium</li>
  <li>Reese&#39;s Sodium Options</li>
  <li>Sodium</li>
  <li>Sodium Extra</li>
  <li>Xaero&#39;s Minimap</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
  The in-game settings are all pretty much set to the lowest they can go, and
  the game was run with Gamemode.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The only other games I tried, aside from solitaire, Space Cadet Pinball and
  battleships (which all ran great) were Run and Run 3 in the broweser. Run
  plays perfectly, but Run 3 lags (although it's still playable, overall).
</p>
<br />
<h4 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h4>
<br />
<p>
  These were ran on a non-fresh boot with Firefox and KeepassXC open so take
  these with a grain of salt.

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<br />
<p>
  TLDR; This 2013 netbook is usable in 2025, but only if you use a lightweight
  Linux setup and know how to optimize the software you&#39;re using.
</p>
<br />
<h4 id="pros">Pros</h4>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Small and lightweight, making it very portable</li>
  <li>Very durable</li>
  <li>Repairable/modular design</li>
  <li>Ethernet port</li>
  <li>Distraction-free, due to less support for games</li>
  <li>Very comfy</li>
  <li>Quiet, even under load</li>
  <li>Conversation starter, I guess</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Relatively slow</li>
  <li>Can&#39;t run many games</li>
  <li>Shitty screen and awful speakers</li>
  <li>Very short battery life and limited options for replacement batteries</li>
  <li>No USB 3.0 or SD card reader</li>
  <li>Tiny annoying arrow keys / overall tacky keyboard</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
  So pretty much, I would not willingly use this as my main computer, but I
  reckon I could, hypothetically. I&#39;m continuing to use this as a portable
  laptop for situations where I don&#39;t need anything better.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The moral of this story is that you don&#39;t need a new computer (unless you
  do).
</p>
<br />
<p>Bye :)</p>
