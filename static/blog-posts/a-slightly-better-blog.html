<p>The <a href='?nav=Blog&entry=a-simple-blog' target='_blank'>first entry</a> in this blog was about my moderately scuffed content management setup. You can read the full post if you want all the context but tldr; I made it so all of the posts (including their contents) are read directly from a JSON file.</p>
<p>This system works fine in theory, but in practice it's extremely annoying to write HTML inside a JSON file.</p>
<br />
<p>My solution to this problem was actually very simple and I don't know why I didn't think of this initially. I also simplified a few other things, as you'll see.</p>
<br />
<p>The original JSON was formatted like this:</p>
<pre><code>[
 {
  "title": "Example Blog Entry",
  "entry": 1,
  "subheading": "This is a blog post",
  "date": "22 September 2024",
  "categories": ["Personal", "Technology"],
  "content": [
   "&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;",
   "&lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;"
  ]
 }
]
</code></pre>
<br />
<p>And the new file is formatted like this:</p>
<pre><code>[
  {
    "title": "Example Blog Entry",
    "subheading": "This is a blog post",
    "date": "22 September 2024",
    "categories": ["Personal" "Technology"]
  }
]
</code></pre>
<br />
<p>Obviously a lot simpler!</p>
<p>I moved the blog posts to individual HTML files in their own directory and made the code for the blog generate a post ID of sorts (instead of specifying one). It does this by taking the <code>title</code> variable and replacing all the spaces with hyphens and converting all the capital letters to lower case.</p>
<p>All of the files in the <code>blog/entries</code> directory are named as <code>&lt;ID&gt;.html</code> and that's how the script searches for them.</p>
<br />
The new directory structure looks like this:
<pre><code>blog/
|
|_ entries/
|  |_ example-blog-post.html
|  |_ another-blog-post.html
|
|_ images/
|  |_ image_from_a_blog_post.jpg
|  |_ another_image_from_a_blog_post.jpg
|
|_ blog.json
</code></pre>
<br />
<p>The IDs are also used in the page URLs, making the old <code>entry</code> variable unnecessary.</p>
<br />
<p>This has made the process of making posts substantially easier, so hopefully I'll use this thing more now.</p>
