<p>Tunneling my homelab to a VPS was really a lot easier than I expected. For a good while I was reluctant to buy a VPS since I didn't know if I was actually going to get it to work, but after seeing <a href='https://blog.ahwx.org/frp' target='_blank'>this</a> article about frp I decided to give it a go.</p>
<br />
<p>The VPS I've gone with is a 2 GB Linode running Alpine Linux and my home servers are running NixOS.</p>
<p>To enable frp on my home server, I've added a module like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
  services.frp = {
    enable = true;
    role = "client";
    settings = {
      serverAddr = "&lt;remote server public IP&gt;";
      serverPort = &lt;server port&gt;;
      auth.method = "token";
      auth.token = "&lt;auth token&gt;";
      transport.protocol = "tcp";
      proxies = [
        {
          name = "&lt;service name&gt;";
          type = "tcp";
          localIP = "&lt;local IP of service&gt;";
          localPort = &lt;local port of service&gt;;
          remotePort = &lt;target port on remote server&gt;;
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
</code></pre>
<br />
<p>To enable it on the VPS I installed frp with <code>sudo apk add frp</code> and wrote the following to <code>/etc/frp/frps.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>bindPort = &lt;server port&gt;
auth.method = "token"
auth.token = "&lt;auth token&gt;"
</code></pre>
<br />
<p>After that, I enabled the service with <code>sudo rc-update add frps default</code>, And that's all there is to it! You can now access all the forwarded services from the address of your VPS.</p>
<br />
<p>I also use Caddy as a reverse proxy to enable HTTPS and map the all of the services to subdomains. To do this all you need is to install Caddy and create a file under <code>/etc/caddy/Caddyfile</code> that looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>"myservice.domain.tld" {
  reverse_proxy localhost:&lt;port&gt;
}
</code></pre>
<p>and run <code>sudo rc-update add caddy default</code>.</p>
<br />
<p>So far it's been very fast and stable, I definitely recommend trying this if you're looking for a way to host your homelab publically without port forwarding or revealing your IP.</p>
